# 💖 Happy Valentine’s Day 🌹

My Mighty Munch, my forever soft place to land.

Loving you feels like laughter that comes too easily, comfort that feels like home, and excitement that never gets old. You have this magical way of making ordinary moments feel special, whether we’re talking nonsense, sharing quiet time, or just existing next to each other. With you, everything feels warmer, lighter, and a little more alive.

You are my joy, my calm, my chaos in the best way, and my biggest blessing. I love how you love, how you care, how you show up as you. Thank you for being my partner, my safe space, my Mighty Munch 🥹💕

Today and every day, I choose you.  
**Always you.**

Happy Valentine’s Day, my love ❤️✨
